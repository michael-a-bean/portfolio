### Professional Summary

Data analyst and business-operations leader with an M.S. in Applied Data Science and over 10 years retail leadership experience. I build end-to-end ETL pipelines, predictive-analytics/machine-learning models, and interactive dashboards using R, Python and Power BI/Tableau. These solutions have increased revenue, cut process inefficiencies, and trimmed ordering costs. Skilled in statistical learning, econometrics, agent-based simulation and supply-chain optimization, I translate analyses into executive-ready insights, able to guide strategy and policy. Seeking business analyst, data scientist or research analyst roles where advanced analytics and data-driven storytelling can unlock measurable stakeholder value.

### Selected Projects

#### [Agent-Based Model of Commodity Price Shock Mitigation](https://michaelbean.org/html/enterprise.html)  
Built NetLogo simulation modeling 100 heterogeneous households with Cobb Douglas production and Ornstein Uhlenbeck price shocks. Executed BehaviorSpace runs and analyzed outputs with penalized GAMs, Pareto frontier optimization, and k-means clustering to assess the effects of policy-based changes to credit, interest rate, and volatility on wealth generation and inequality.


#### [Household Resilience to Commodity Price Shocks](https://michaelbean.org/html/commodity.html)   
Engineered volatility weighted exposure and shock indices for Ethiopian households using LSMS-ISA panel data (2010-2016) and a panel of globally-traded commodity prices. Applied Driscoll-Kraay two way fixed effects regression analysis showing forest cover/agroforestry practice buffer household consumption and food security against negative price shocks.

#### Agricultural Practices & Price Shocks in Ethiopian Coffee  
Analyzed panel observations of coffee farming households using Driscoll‚ÄìKraay TWFE and an stacking ensemble using elastic-net regularization (Random Forest, GBM, XGBoost) to quantify how crop rotation, fertilizer application, agricultural extension services, and credit access mediate household consumption responses to commodity price volatility.
