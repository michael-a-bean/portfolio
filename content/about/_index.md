### Selected Projects

#### Agent-Based Model of Commodity Price Shock Mitigation  
Built NetLogo simulation modeling 100 heterogeneous households with Cobb-Douglas production and Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck price shocks. Ran 30,000 BehaviorSpace experiments, analyzed outputs with penalized GAMs and k-means clustering to evaluate policy impacts on wealth and inequality.

#### Household Resilience to Commodity Price Shocks  
Created volatility-weighted exposure and shock indices using LSMS-ISA panel data (Ethiopia) and global commodity prices. Applied Driscoll‚ÄìKraay two-way fixed effects regression to show that forest cover and agroforestry buffer household food security against price shocks.

#### Agricultural Practices & Price Shocks in Ethiopian Coffee  
Analyzed panel data from coffee farming households using elastic net ensembles (RF, GBM, XGBoost) and Driscoll‚ÄìKraay models to evaluate how rotation, fertilizer, credit access, and extension services mediate consumption response to commodity price volatility.
